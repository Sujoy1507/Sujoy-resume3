                        Hi, I’m Sujoy Saha, an aspiring full stack web developer from Karaigachhi, West Bengal. I'm
                        currently on a dedicated journey to learn web development, focusing on both frontend and backend
                        technologies. I started this path with a deep interest in how the web works and a strong desire
                        to build useful, beautiful websites that make a difference.

                        I’m currently learning through Angela Yu’s Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, where I’m
                        gaining practical knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and more. Every
                        day, I dedicate 4–5 hours to learning and building — I believe consistency beats talent when
                        talent doesn't practice.

                        I enjoy working on real-world projects that allow me to apply my knowledge and grow. Whether
                        it’s crafting responsive layouts, designing clean user interfaces, or exploring backend logic,
                        I’m always excited to solve problems with code.

                        Beyond tech, I’m a curious learner who values discipline, creativity, and growth. My goal is to
                        become a professional developer and contribute to impactful web applications, while continuously
                        improving my skills.

                        Let’s connect and create something meaningful together.
